The viewer provide two functions:
1) visualize final results of multiple experiments
which are stored in folder .../bldgs_final
Please make sure the parcel data named "parcelle.shp" is also in the same directory

2) visualize evolution (intermediate results) of one experiment
which is stored in a txt file, e.g.  .../bldgs/bldgs_exp9.txt
Please make sure the parcel data named "parcelle.shp" is also in the same directory

Manipulation:
use left mouse button to translate and rotate the scene
